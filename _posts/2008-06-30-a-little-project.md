Thanks to spending a few hours first watching [Jay-Z at Glastonbury](http://news.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/hi/music/newsid_7479000/7479923.stm) and then the 5-set epic that was the [Murray-Gasquet](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/7482226.stm) match at Wimbledon today, I have found myself sat in front of the laptop hacking away at a little project that came to mind late last week.

I'm sure it has been done many time before, but as I've said before, reinventing the wheel can be quite fun sometimes.

So, for no reason in particular, I present to you [JavaScript Tetris](/games/tetris/). Enjoy.
