There's a lot of buzz around at the moment for [Moo's MiniCards](http://www.moo.com) - business cards using your photos from [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com). What's even better is the offer to all Pro users to get 10 cards free - mine should arrive in the next 10 days.

The site has been very well designed and is very simple to use. It took all of about 5 minutes to get my cards ordered - once I had picked the photos of course.

At only $19.99 for a pack of 100, its a great way to get business cards with a very personal touch. Considering I don't often have a reason to hand out a business card, 100 would last me a long time.
