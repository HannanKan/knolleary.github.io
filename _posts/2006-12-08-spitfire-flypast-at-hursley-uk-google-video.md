As a mark of respect for a member of the original Spitfire design team who passed away recently, the Spitfire Society arranged a flypast of Hursley House on Friday 8th December.

I forgot my camera, so my phone stood in. The video quality isn't great, but it does give some sense of the event. There were plenty of photographers out on the lawn, so I'm sure [Flickr](http://flickr.com) will soon be flooded with photos from the event.

Hursley was where the Spitfire engines were developed - long before IBM got there.
