I've made some updates to the MQTT library for the arduino ethernet shield and released version 1.1. You can find the library [here](http://knolleary.net/arduino-client-for-mqtt/). <strike>I'm thinking of moving it to github or google code once I can decide which to use - any suggestions?</strike> The code is now hosted on [github](http://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient/tree/master).

This update includes:

*   smaller code footprint,
*   support for Will messages - particularly useful for embedded devices,
*   clarified licensing - this is released under the [MIT License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).

Enjoy.
