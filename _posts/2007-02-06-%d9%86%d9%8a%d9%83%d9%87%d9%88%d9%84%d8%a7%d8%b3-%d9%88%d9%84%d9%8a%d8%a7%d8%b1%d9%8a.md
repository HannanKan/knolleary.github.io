Has [Roo](http://rooreynolds.com/2007/02/05/%d8%b1%d9%88%d9%88-%d8%b1%d9%8a%d9%8a%d9%86%d9%88%d9%84%d8%af%d8%b3/) started a [meme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme)? Only time and the internet Gods will tell.

My name transliterated to Arabic is Ù†ÙŠÙƒÙ‡Ù^Ù"Ø§Ø³ Ù^'Ù"ÙŠØ§Ø±.

Thanks go to [Rob's transliteration tool](http://robsmart.co.uk/2007/02/02/transliteration-again-now-complete/).

_update:_ weirdness abounds. The trackback to Rob's blog has worked fine, however the trackback on Roo's post has broken the URL. All three blogs are running Wordpress, and Roo's is hosted on the same machine as this one. Odd.
