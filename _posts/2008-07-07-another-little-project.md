Having done [tetris](/2008/06/30/a-little-project/) last week, I got a number of suggestions for improvements in the comments. Whilst I don't rule out tackling them at some point, I had an itch to do something different. So I started the next project. Admittedly, this one has taken quiet a bit more time to do and it isn't a finished end-to-end game like tetris is. But still, the concept is there and I could spend some more time on it or I could start the next project.

So, for still no reason in particular, I present to you [JavaScript Mario](/games/scroller/). Enjoy.
