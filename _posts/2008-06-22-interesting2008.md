Yesterday was the awesome Interesting2008 organised by [Russell Davies](http://russelldavies.typepad.com/). Roo had told me all about last year's Interesting2007, so I was very much look forward to it - and I wasn't disappointed.

The talks covered a diverse range of subjects and they were all interesting - as you would hope for such an event. Here are some of my highlights of the day.

[Roo](http://rooreynolds.com) opened with 3 minutes on Lego. With 30 slides playing through behind him, he even remembered to breathe. A great start to the day. Roo has now [posted](http://www.slideshare.net/rooreynolds/lego-is-full-of-win) his slides with audio on slideshare.

[Michael Johnson](http://www.johnsonbanks.co.uk/thoughtfortheweek/index.php?thoughtid=336) gave us tour through the history of guitar music and graphic design. Was this just an excuse to play Jimi Hendrix on a stage in front of 300 people?

[Matt Dent](http://www.mattdent.com/) spoke about the new coin designs he did. Fascinating insight to the amount of detail that goes into this type of thing.

[Lloyd Davis](http://perfectpath.wordpress.com) played the ukulele and then helped the whole room meditate and bring the mountain within. And relax.

[Anna Pickard](http://littleredboat.co.uk/) just about kept a straight face whilst talking about unintentionally funny words. I was most pleased to see Plinth on the list.

[Andrew Walkingshaw](http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/walkingshaw/) explained why naming things is hard.

[Jim Le Fevre](http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/filmnetwork/U5241804) amazed us all by showing off his turntable-based zoetrope. I could have watched this for hours. Definitely something to play with in the future. _Update:_ [Russell](http://russelldavies.typepad.com/planning/2008/06/jim-on-youtube.html) has linked to a YouTube video of this stuff - amazing.

Russell did a great job of organising the day - I'm very much looking forward to Interesting2009.
