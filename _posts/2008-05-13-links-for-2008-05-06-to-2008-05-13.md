*   [Official Google Reader Blog: Brand new Google Reader for iPhone](http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2008/05/brand-new-google-reader-for-iphone.html) - Look forward to trying this on the N800 which does struggle with the standard reader interface.
*   [MAKE: Blog: Arduino wifi shield](http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2008/05/arduino_wifi_shield.html?CMP=OTC-0D6B48984890) - The first wifi shield I&#39;ve seen. But at $295, not something I&#39;m going to rush out to get.
*   [CrunchBang ~ GIMP Lomo Filter](http://crunchbang.org/archives/2007/11/29/gimp-lomo-filter/) - Nice lomo effect filter for GIMP
*   [Open Tech 2008 - 5th July in London.](http://www.ukuug.org/events/opentech2008/) - "Open Tech 2008 is an informal, low cost one-day conference on technology, society and low-carbon living, featuring Open Source ways of working and technologies that anyone can have a go at."
*   [Ethernet Shield V1.0 for Arduino Arduino Etherenet Shield with ENC28J60 SPI [] - &pound;12.99 : nuelectronics.com, new idea, new project, new electronics](http://www.nuelectronics.com/estore/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=4&zenid=f4a809dbb7bbdf8de855ded5dd7452e9) - Another ethernet shield for an Arduino. Cheaper than the XPort based one, but not as powerful out of the box. Am currently working on an improved TCP stack for it.
