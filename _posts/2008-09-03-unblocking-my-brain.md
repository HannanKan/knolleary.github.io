I'm going to say it up front - I did not intend this to be a blog post about blogging, but I think that is the way it is going.

I don't write as often as I would like. I think I have set the bar too high in my mind in terms of what I should and shouldn't write here. I have all manner of ideas for posts, but they never seem to make their way onto the proverbial paper.

I get very self-critical about anything I write. In fact, its taken me about 10minutes to get this far - just over 100 words. I often ask myself why I'm like this. I think it is because I want every post to be a good one. I want anyone reading this blog to read one entry and feel like it is worth reading more.

I need to get over this. I need to find my own style and stop trying to produce the perfect post every time. I need to recognise that finding my own style does not, and will not, happen overnight. I need to not be afraid of getting it wrong.

Now, I could just delete what I have written here and carry on with my life. I could save it as a draft to keep it around as a reminder of these things. Or, I could publish it to the world and really mean it.

Publishing it means I've got to think of a suitable title - do I go for my favoured wry sense of humour or a more obvious statement of the content. Give me 10 minutes and I'm sure something will come to mind.
