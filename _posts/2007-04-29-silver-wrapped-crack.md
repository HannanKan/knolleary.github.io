I blame [Roo](http://rooreynolds.com). Having had a look at some of his [Perplex City](http://www.perplexcity.com/) cards last week, today I went and got some of my own from Season 2.

Here are today's stats:

*   3 packs bought - initially I bought 2, but when Jo went back to the till to buy another book, I added another pack.
*   18 puzzle cards and 3 'warm-up' sudoku and hitori cards.
*   15 cards solved - particularly pleased with #161.
*   4320 points gained.
*   Ranked 1124 at the time of writing.
*   Close to solving the 16th card (#164) - I know the reference, just not sure how to get an answer to fit.
*   Unsure where to begin with the 17th card (#235).
*   18th card available for swaps (#004).

This is an addiction. I am an [addict](http://www.perplexcity.com/profile/knolleary). I need more cards.
