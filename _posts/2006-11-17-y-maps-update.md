Since Flickr added the ability to geo-tag photos by dropping them onto a map provided by [Yahoo Maps](http://maps.yahoo.com/) I have been keenly updating my photos as best I can. The main limitation has been the level of detail available outside the US on their maps. Note the past tense. Whilst working on my [honeymoon photos](http://flickr.com/photos/knolleary/sets/72157594380498192/) I spotted that whilst I was away they have been busy updating their maps. I don't know how wide-spread the update is, but it certainly looks good for my [local](http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=m&q1=southampton%2Cuk&trf=0&lon=-1.410198&lat=50.910069&mag=6) area, as well as where we were went on holiday - [Lanzarote](http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=m&trf=0&lon=-13.706818&lat=28.918889&mag=4).

Although, Google still wins for level of detail in the satellite image for that particular area - [here's](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?ie=UTF8&z=19&ll=28.91702,-13.710441&spn=0.001103,0.001829&t=h&om=1) our hotel.
