[Roo](http://rooreynolds.com) lived up to his role as Best Man last weekend by organising a Surfing trip to [Woolacombe](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=woolacombe&ie=UTF8&z=14&ll=51.17337,-4.206305&spn=0.025292,0.069094&om=1) for my Stag weekend.

I have surfed a few times in the last couple years but it was good to have a day of properly organised tuition - thanks to Matt from [Nick Thorn](http://www.nickthorn.com/)'s surf school for that. Thanks also to the guys at [Extreme Board Shots](http://www.extremeboardshots.com) for photographing the day in the water.

Whilst not everyone I had hoped could make the weekend, fun was definitely had by all.
