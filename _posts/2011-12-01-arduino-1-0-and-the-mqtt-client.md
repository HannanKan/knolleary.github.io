With the long-awaited [release of Arduino 1.0](http://arduino.cc/blog/2011/11/30/arduino-1-0-now-available/), it is time to do a new release of the MQTT client.

Aside from some internal updates needed due to API changes in 1.0, this client has the improved keep-alive handling that I mentioned back in [May](/2011/05/25/staying-connected/).

As ever, links to the download on the [project page](https://pubsubclient.knolleary.net).
