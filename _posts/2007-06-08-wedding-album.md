Only 7 months after the wedding, we have finally gotten around to putting the 'official' photos online. These are a combination of photos taken by my Dad and ones added by our friends to the [flickr pool](http://flickr.com/groups/nick-and-jo/). The hard-copy of the album was done at Christmas, but it has taken a while to figure out what we wanted to do online; there didn't seem to be an obvious choice for maintaining the look and feel of the actual thing. So, enjoy some hand-crafted html and javascript - would you expect anything less?
