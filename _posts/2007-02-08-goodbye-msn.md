I've had an MSN id since University. It has had two uses:

*   to act as a spam hole for sites that need an e-mail address,
*   and to let me chat on the MSN network.

I've [mentioned](/2006/11/23/windows-live-mail/) before that I don't feel particularly compelled to keep the ID active. I'm not sure what has led me to make this decision, but today I have decided to let the ID expire and say goodbye to the MSN network.

Most of my contacts are on Google Talk and this evening I have prompted one to start using it more - I even got him to install the Windows version of [Gaim](http://gaim.sourceforge.net/win32/index.php).

So, if you've got my MSN id and not my Google Talk one (unlikely)... let me know. If you don't have either and want it... let me know.

In other news, my Web2.0 rating has just increased a notch with the addition of my [last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/knolleary/) account.
