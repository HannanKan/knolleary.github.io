After two and a half years in my flat, Jo and I have decided its time to move on. Where exactly has yet to be determined, although we do plan to stay in or around [West End](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=West+End,+Southampton,+Hampshire,+United+Kingdom&ie=UTF8&hl=en&sll=53.098145,-2.443696&sspn=12.421367,29.882813&z=12&ll=50.932902,-1.332779&spn=0.101695,0.346069&om=1&iwloc=addr).

Since Jo moved in after the wedding, we have struggled for space and found ourselves frequently taking trips to the local charity shop with bags of clothes and other assorted items.

When I bought the flat, the plan had been for the 2nd bedroom to become an office. Unfortunately I have barely spent any time in there; it became the dumping ground for anything that didn't fit elsewhere. It was quite a task last Sunday to de-clutter the surfaces so it would be ready for viewings. I just hope the estate agent doesn't open any of the wardrobes...

It seems a bit ironic that it's the prospect of selling the flat that has lead us to tidy it this much.

More details on the flat are available [here](http://www.pure365.co.uk/eDetails.asp?Category=Residential&ID=MRWESHA15J353).
