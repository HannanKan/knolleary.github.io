Why do pier's tend to burn down? True they are often made of wood, but they are also usually surrounded by sea.  

Southend's pier maybe the longest _pleasure_ pier in the world, at a leg aching 1.33 miles, but I wonder what's a pier thats not for pleasure? A _business_ pier?  

When arriving at the sea-side, do you get stopped and asked if you are there for business or pleasure and then get directed to the appropriate pier?  

This may seem a random post, but at least it proves the hook-up from flickr to this blog works.
