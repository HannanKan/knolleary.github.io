I have added a new section to the site - [Planet Knolleary](http://knolleary.net/planet). This is a collection of the feeds I read on a regular basis. The software used is Sam Ruby's [Venus](http://intertwingly.net/code/venus/) refactoring of the [Planet](http://planetplanet.org) software. It's also currently using Sam's own theme - something I will be replacing with a more in-keeping style. The list of feeds it's subscribed to will vary as I get the balance right.

Oh, and in the same style of my del.icio.us links, there are now the top 5 entries from the planet in the sidebar.
