I'm still finding my feet with video on linux - it involves too many command line tools and too much documentation reading at the moment. This relatively simple video has taken much more effort than I was expecting.

For a first attempt, it'll do. It's a shame the scale of the graph jumps around - it does detract from the effect slightly.
