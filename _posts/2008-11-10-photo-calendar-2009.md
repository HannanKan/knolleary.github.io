I like to take the odd [photo](http://flickr.com/photos/knolleary) now and then. Last year, with the help of [Lulu](http://lulu.com) I put together a calendar that featured some of my favourite photos as a Christmas present for my parents and in-laws.

This year I have done the same, and as the surprise factor is no longer there, I have decided to make it available to anyone who wants to buy one. They cost Â£8.25 excluding postage - none of which is profit or will go to charity.
