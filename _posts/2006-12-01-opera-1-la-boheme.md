Tonight my parents treated Jo and I to our first opera; the [Welsh Nation Opera](http://www.wno.org.uk)'s production of [La BohÃ¨me](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_boheme) at Southampton's [Mayflower](http://www.the-mayflower.com/) theatre.

It was a very impressive production, although the orchestra did drown the leads on occasion.

The lesson I learned tonight, taken from the programme:
> There were girls who did and girls who didn't and the rule of thumb was that those who succumbed rarely made it to the final curtain.

Apparently, Mimi is a girl who did.
