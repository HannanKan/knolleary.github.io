Today was the first [homecamp](http://homecamp.pbwiki.com/) - "an unconference about using technology to monitor and automate the home for greener resource use and to save costs".

Whilst I hadn't entirely planned to, I found myself stood up front leading a couple sessions; one on what I've been doing with [arduino](http://knolleary.net/tag/arduino) and one a brief overview of what [MQTT](http://mqtt.org) is.

As the wireless was only staying up for 30 minutes at a time, my arduino talk is split over a couple UStream videos. I come in at about 22:40 of this first one...

...and the rest is here with only a small gap missing between them.

Here's the brief piece I did on all things MQTT, RSMB and MicroBroker. You should listen to Chris talk about his [SketchUp plugin for Pachube](http://sketchup.pachube.com/) at the start of the video, or you can skip to me at 14:20.

The rest of the videos are worth watching - they can be found on the [homecamp ustream page](http://www.ustream.tv/channel/homecamp).

Here are the slides I was using for the arduino talk. I will add some notes to them over the next couple days, so be sure to check back on [slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/knolleary/arduino-home-automation-hacks-presentation).

One other contribution I made to the day was winning the race to respond to Andy's [request](http://twitter.com/andypiper/status/1029495958) for a homecamp logo. You can see my effort at the top of this post as well as on the official [homecamp friendfeed room](http://friendfeed.com/rooms/homecamp). Since then, [@ribot](http://twitter.com/ribot) has produced this decidedly more [shiny one](http://ribot.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/homecamp.png).

Today was a lot of fun with plenty of interesting and inspiring conversations. A big thank you and well done to Chris and Dale for putting this together so quickly. I look forward to HomeCamp '09.
