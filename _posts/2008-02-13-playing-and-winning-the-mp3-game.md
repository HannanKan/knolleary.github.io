For a long time there hasn't been a viable option for linux users to buy main-stream DRM-free music in the UK. I have looked at the various independent stores out there, but they simply don't have the music I want. I have been eagerly waiting for Amazon to launch its MP3 store - something they recently [confirmed](http://www.boingboing.net/2008/01/27/amazon-mp3-store-to.html) would happen at some point this year.

But today, out of nowhere, play.com have just launched their own [music store](http://www.play.com/Music/MP3-Download/6-/DigitalHome.html). That's right - I didn't say 'announced' or 'promised'; they have actually launched it today and I have bought my very first MP3 album (for the record, Adele's 19).

Their [FAQ](https://www.play.com/Helpdesk.aspx?page=PlayDigitalFAQ&r=HOME) have all the gory details; music is availble at either 192Kbit/s or 320Kbit/s depending on the recording, can be redownloaded a (limited) number of times and are unencumbered of any DRM. They only have content from EMI and some independent labels at the moment, but this is certainly a good start.

According to [The Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/02/13/play_uk_drm_free/), where I first heard the news, all tracks will be 320Kbit/s eventually, with the average price being 70p/track or Â£6.99/album.

All considered, play have won the race as far as I am concerned. Amazon will have to do something pretty special to make me look their way.
