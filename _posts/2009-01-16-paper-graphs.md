With [PaperCamp](http://magicalnihilism.wordpress.com/2008/10/29/papercamp/) happening tomorrow, alongside [BookCamp](http://bookcamp09.eventbrite.com/), I have spent some time this week thinking about paper.

The thought that caught my interest was how graphs can be represented with paper - not _on_ paper, but _with_ paper.

To cut a rambling story short, I've written a tool that takes a set of pie-chart data and produces a series of outlines that can be cut out and assembled to create a 3D model of the chart.

Having a physical embodiment of the raw data means you can touch it, feel it, grope it; whatever helps you understand it.

I think I'll leave it there for now; it's late, I have an early train to catch and I've used the word grope.

_Update:_ as I mention in the comments, you can get your own custom paper pie chart from [here](http://knolleary.net/paper-graphs).
