Roo has got an interesting [post](http://rooreynolds.com/2007/01/27/bbc-20/) on his recent visit to the BBC; it certain sounds like they are heading in good directions.

In the comments, [Andy Piper](http://andypiper.wordpress.com/) linked to [The BBC's Fifteen Web Principles](http://www.tomski.com/archive/new_archive/000063.html). They make a lot of sense and should be required reading for anyone interested in the subject.

I particularly like the line:

**13. Let people paste your content on the walls of their virtual homes**

It encapsulates everything I enjoy about the internet these days.
