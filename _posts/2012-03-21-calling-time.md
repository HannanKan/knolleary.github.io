One of my plans for the year was to take photo everyday. I knew it would be a challenge as I spend most days at my desk in work. Trying to find a different, interesting photo everyday when I'm not visiting new places all the time meant opening my eyes to the everyday.

But it hasn't really worked out like that. Looking through the photos to date, too many have been taken after 10pm as I'm heading to bed and needed to take a photo of _something_. 

How else can I explain the [photo of an orange](http://www.flickr.com/photos/knolleary/6780618562/in/set-72157628670264651)?

Then last week, we were ill and although I dutifully took a photo each day, I didn't get around to uploading them. Last night, sat in bed, I realised I hadn't done that day's photo.

All of these factors have resulted in my decision to stop the Flickr 366 project. It had become a chore and not fun.

I'm glad I tried and I'm sure I'll try again in the future, but the [366:2012 set on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/knolleary/sets/72157628670264651) is done.
