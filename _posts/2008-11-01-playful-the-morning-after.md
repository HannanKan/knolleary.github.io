Yesterday's Playful conference was a lot of fun. The day was packed with a lot of varied talks with no low spots. Here's a very brief summary of what happened. It's brief as I don't take notes at conferences. Not because I don't believe in it, but because I forget.

*   [James Wallis](http://www.spaaace.com) spoke about [OuLiPo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oulipo)
*   Roo [rocked out](http://flickr.com/photos/knolleary/2990728421/)
*   Matt Irvine Brown talked about drawing more dots to enable others to join them. His [TrumpetHero](http://www.irvinebrown.com/controllers.html) and [Singing Sock Puppets](http://www.irvinebrown.com/puppet_loop.html) were inspired.
*   [Adrian Hon](http://www.sixtostart.com/) gave a very honest account of how gaming can be addictive as well as cause addiction.
*   Eric Clough took us through the incredible [New York apartment](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/12/garden/12puzzle.html?pagewanted=all) he designed as one big puzzle.
*   Chris Delay of [Introversion Software](http://www.introversion.co.uk/index.html) demonstrated how procedural content generation can be used to generate entire city-scapes.
*   [Kars Alfrink](http://leapfrog.nl/) did something interesting.<del datetime="2008-11-17T13:03:08+00:00">but my brain has ejected it. Sorry Kars, I look forward to rediscovering your talk.</del> He has put a full transcript of his talk [online](http://leapfrog.nl/blog/archives/2008/11/17/a-playful-stance-my-game-design-london-2008-talk/). Thanks Kars!
*   [Alex Fleetwood](http://www.hideandseekfest.co.uk/) spoke about his project to combine virtual and real world dramatic experiences
*   [Tom Armitage](http://infovore.org/) went from saying "all games today are multiplayer" to "all games have always been multiplayer".
*   Sandy Spangler from Sony stepped in at the last minute to talk about the history and future of the EyeToy.
*   [Eric Zimmerman](http://www.ericzimmerman.com/) gave a very energetic performance. Again, my brain fails me this morning.
*   [Matt Biddulph](http://www.hackdiary.com) explained how game controllers can easily be tinkered with to provide new and interesting uses
*   [Iain Tate](http://www.crackunit.com/) talked about why the Highscore is a key feature of social gaming.
*   [Jolyon Webb](http://www.blitzgamesstudios.com/) talked about teeth with some very life-like CG heads
*   [Kieron Gillen](http://www.kierongillen.com/) ended the day encouraging us all to plagarise ideas. Why has no-one cloned The Sims yet?

Well done to the guys at [Pixel-Lab](http://www.pixel-lab.co.uk/) for putting this together. I look forward to next year.
